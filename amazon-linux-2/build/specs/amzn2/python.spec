Patch0: python-2.7.1-config.patch

# Removes the "-g" option from "pydoc", for some reason; I believe
# (dmalcolm 2010-01-29) that this was introduced in this change:
# - fix pydoc (#68082)
# in 2.2.1-12 as a response to the -g option needing TkInter installed
# (Red Hat Linux 8)
# Not upstream
Patch1: 00001-pydocnogui.patch

# though the proposed upstream patches are, alas, different
Patch6: python-2.5.1-plural-fix.patch

# This patch was listed in the changelog as:
#  * Fri Sep 14 2007 Jeremy Katz <katzj@redhat.com> - 2.5.1-11
#  - fix encoding of sqlite .py files to work around weird encoding problem
#  in Turkish (#283331)
# A traceback attached to rhbz 244016 shows the problem most clearly: a
# traceback on attempting to import the sqlite module, with:
#   "SyntaxError: encoding problem: with BOM (__init__.py, line 1)"
# This seems to come from Parser/tokenizer.c:check_coding_spec
# Our patch changes two source files within sqlite3, removing the
# "coding: ISO-8859-1" specs and character E4 = U+00E4 =
# LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS from in ghaering's surname.
#
# It may be that the conversion of "ISO-8859-1" to "iso-8859-1" is thwarted
# by the implementation of "tolower" in the Turkish locale; see:
#   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=191096#c9
#
# TODO: Not yet sent upstream, and appears to me (dmalcolm 2010-01-29) that
# it may be papering over a symptom
Patch7: python-2.5.1-sqlite-encoding.patch

# FIXME: Lib/ctypes/util.py posix implementation defines a function
# _get_soname(f).  Upstreams's implementation of this uses objdump to read the
# SONAME from a library; we avoid this, apparently to minimize space

# Not upstream
Patch102: 00102-2.7.13-lib64.patch

# Python 2.7 split out much of the path-handling from distutils/sysconfig.py to
# a new sysconfig.py (in r77704).
# We need to make equivalent changes to that new file to ensure that the stdlib
# and platform-specific code go to /usr/lib64 not /usr/lib, on 64-bit archs:

# 00104 #
# Only used when "%{_lib}" == "lib64"
# Another lib64 fix, for distutils/tests/test_install.py; not upstream:
Patch104: 00104-lib64-fix-for-test_install.patch

# 00111 #
# Patch the Makefile.pre.in so that the generated Makefile doesn't try to build
# a libpythonMAJOR.MINOR.a (bug 550692):
# Downstream only: not appropriate for upstream
Patch111: 00111-no-static-lib.patch

# 00112 #
# Patch to support building both optimized vs debug stacks DSO ABIs, sharing
# the same .py and .pyc files, using "_d.so" to signify a debug build of an
# extension module.
#
# Based on Debian's patch for the same,
#  http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/python2.6/2.6.5-2/debug-build.dpatch
#
# (which was itself based on the upstream Windows build), but with some
# changes:
#
#   * Debian's patch to dynload_shlib.c looks for module_d.so, then module.so,
# but this can potentially find a module built against the wrong DSO ABI.  We
# instead search for just module_d.so in a debug build
#
#   * We remove this change from configure.in's build of the Makefile:
#   SO=$DEBUG_EXT.so
# so that sysconfig.py:customize_compiler stays with shared_lib_extension='.so'
# on debug builds, so that UnixCCompiler.find_library_file can find system
# libraries (otherwise "make sharedlibs" fails to find system libraries,
# erroneously looking e.g. for "libffi_d.so" rather than "libffi.so")
#
#   * We change Lib/distutils/command/build_ext.py:build_ext.get_ext_filename
# to add the _d there, when building an extension.  This way, "make sharedlibs"
# can build ctypes, by finding the sysmtem libffi.so (rather than failing to
# find "libffi_d.so"), and builds the module as _ctypes_d.so
#
#   * Similarly, update build_ext:get_libraries handling of Py_ENABLE_SHARED by
# appending "_d" to the python library's name for the debug configuration
#
#   * We modify Modules/makesetup to add the "_d" to the generated Makefile
# rules for the various Modules/*.so targets
#
# This may introduce issues when building an extension that links directly
# against another extension (e.g. users of NumPy?), but seems more robust when
# searching for external libraries
#
#   * We don't change Lib/distutils/command/build.py: build.build_purelib to
# embed plat_specifier, leaving it as is, as pure python builds should be
# unaffected by these differences (we'll be sharing the .py and .pyc files)
#
#   * We introduce DEBUG_SUFFIX as well as DEBUG_EXT:
#     - DEBUG_EXT is used by ELF files (names and SONAMEs); it will be "_d" for
# a debug build
#     - DEBUG_SUFFIX is used by filesystem paths; it will be "-debug" for a
# debug build
#
#   Both will be empty in an optimized build.  "_d" contains characters that
# are valid ELF metadata, but this leads to various ugly filesystem paths (such
# as the include path), and DEBUG_SUFFIX allows these paths to have more natural
# names.  Changing this requires changes elsewhere in the distutils code.
#
#   * We add DEBUG_SUFFIX to PYTHON in the Makefile, so that the two
# configurations build parallel-installable binaries with different names
# ("python-debug" vs "python").
#
#   * Similarly, we add DEBUG_SUFFIX within python-config and
#  python$(VERSION)-config, so that the two configuration get different paths
#  for these.
#
#  See also patch 130 below

# Upstream r79310 removed the "Modules" directory from sys.path when Python is
# running from the build directory on POSIX to fix a unit test (issue #8205).
# This seems to have broken the compileall.py done in "make install": it cannot
# find shared library extension modules at this point in the build (sys.path
# does not contain DESTDIR/usr/lib(64)/python-2.7/lib-dynload for some reason),
# leading to the build failing with:
# Traceback (most recent call last):

# Support OpenSSL FIPS mode (e.g. when OPENSSL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE=1 is set)
# - handle failures from OpenSSL (e.g. on attempts to use MD5 in a
#   FIPS-enforcing environment)
# - add a new "usedforsecurity" keyword argument to the various digest
#   algorithms in hashlib so that you can whitelist a callsite with
#   "usedforsecurity=False"
# (sent upstream for python 3 as http://bugs.python.org/issue9216; this is a
# backport to python 2.7; see RHEL6 patch 119)
# - enforce usage of the _hashlib implementation: don't fall back to the _md5
#   and _sha* modules (leading to clearer error messages if fips selftests
#   fail)
# - don't build the _md5 and _sha* modules; rely on the _hashlib implementation
#   of hashlib (for example, md5.py will use _hashlib's implementation of MD5,
#   if permitted by the FIPS setting)

# (New patches go here ^^^)
#
# When adding new patches to "python" and "python3" in Fedora 17 onwards,

#
#   - use the same patch number across both specfiles for conceptually-equivalent
#     fixes, ideally with the same name
#
#   - when a patch is relevant to both specfiles, use the same introductory
#     comment in both specfiles where possible (to improve "diff" output when
#     comparing them)
#
#   - when a patch is only relevant for one of the two specfiles, leave a gap
#     in the patch numbering in the other specfile, adding a comment when
#     omitting a patch, both in the manifest section here, and in the "prep"
#     phase below
#
# Hopefully this will make it easier to ensure that all relevant fixes are
# applied to both versions.

%description
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes
modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and
dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and
libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
Mac and MFC).

Programmers can write new built-in modules for Python in C or C++.
Python can be used as an extension language for applications that need
a programmable interface.

Note that documentation for Python is provided in the python-docs
package.

This package provides the "python" executable; most of the actual
implementation is within the "python-libs" package.

%package libs
Summary: Runtime libraries for Python
Group: Applications/System

# Needed for ctypes, to load libraries, worked around for Live CDs size
# Requires: binutils

# expat 2.1.0 added the symbol XML_SetHashSalt without bumping SONAME.  We use
# this symbol (in pyexpat), so we must explicitly state this dependency to
# prevent "import pyexpat" from failing with a linker error if someone hasn't
# yet upgraded expat:
Requires: expat >= 2.1.0

%description libs
This package contains runtime libraries for use by Python:
- the libpython dynamic library, for use by applications that embed Python as
a scripting language, and by the main "python" executable
- the Python standard library

%package devel
Summary: The libraries and header files needed for Python development
Group: Development/Libraries
Requires: %{python}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: pkgconfig

# package
Conflicts: %{python} < %{version}-%{release}

Provides: python2-devel = %{version}-%{release}
%endif

%description devel
The Python programming language's interpreter can be extended with
dynamically loaded extensions and can be embedded in other programs.
This package contains the header files and libraries needed to do
these types of tasks.

Install python-devel if you want to develop Python extensions.  The
python package will also need to be installed.  You'll probably also
want to install the python-docs package, which contains Python
documentation.

%package tools
Summary: A collection of development tools included with Python
Group: Development/Tools
Requires: %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{tkinter} = %{version}-%{release}
%if %{main_python}
Obsoletes: python2-tools
Provides: python2-tools = %{version}
%endif

%description tools
This package includes several tools to help with the development of Python
programs, including IDLE (an IDE with editing and debugging facilities), a
color editor (pynche), and a python gettext program (pygettext.py).

%package -n %{tkinter}
Summary: A graphical user interface for the Python scripting language
Group: Development/Languages
Requires: %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
%if %{main_python}
Obsoletes: tkinter2
Provides: tkinter2 = %{version}
%endif

%description -n %{tkinter}

The Tkinter (Tk interface) program is an graphical user interface for
the Python scripting language.

You should install the tkinter package if you'd like to use a graphical
user interface for Python programming.

%package test
Summary: The test modules from the main python package
Group: Development/Languages
Requires: %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Provides: python2-test = %{version}

%description test

The test modules from the main python package: %{name}
These have been removed to save space, as they are never or almost
never used in production.

You might want to install the python-test package if you're developing python
code that uses more than just unittest and/or test_support.py.

%if 0%{?with_debug_build}
%package debug
Summary: Debug version of the Python runtime
Group: Applications/System

# The debug build is an all-in-one package version of the regular build, and
# shares the same .py/.pyc files and directories as the regular build.  Hence
# we depend on all of the subpackages of the regular build:
Requires: %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{name}-libs%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{name}-devel%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{name}-test%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: tkinter%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{name}-tools%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description debug
python-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users, such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues, and other bugs.

The bytecodes are unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between the two
version of Python, but the debugging features mean that C/C++ extension modules
are ABI-incompatible with those built for the standard runtime.

It shares installation directories with the standard Python runtime, so that
.py and .pyc files can be shared.  All compiled extension modules gain a "_d"
suffix ("foo_d.so" rather than "foo.so") so that each Python implementation can
load its own extensions.

- revise the systemtap patch (patch 55:python-2.6.4-dtrace.patch) to the
new version by mjw in attachment 390110 of rhbz:545179, as this should
eliminate the performance penalty for the case where the probes aren't in

- move the -gdb.py file from %%{_libdir}/INSTSONAME-gdb.py to
%%{_prefix}/lib/debug/%%{_libdir}/INSTSONAME.debug-gdb.py to avoid noise from
ldconfig (bug 562980), and which should also ensure it becomes part of the
debuginfo subpackage, rather than the libs subpackage
- introduce %%{py_SOVERSION} and %%{py_INSTSONAME} to reflect the upstream
configure script, and to avoid fragile scripts that try to figure this out
dynamically (e.g. for the -gdb.py change)

- work around bug 562906 by supplying a fixed version of pythondeps.sh

- remove embedded copy of expat from source tree during "prep"

* Mon Jan 25 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 2.6.4-10
- introduce macros for 3 directories, replacing expanded references throughout:
%%{pylibdir}, %%{dynload_dir}, %%{site_packages}
- explicitly list all lib-dynload files, rather than dynamically gathering the
payload into a temporary text file, so that we can be sure what we are
shipping; remove now-redundant testing for presence of certain .so files
- remove embedded copy of zlib from source tree before building

* Mon Jan 25 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 2.6.4-9
- change python-2.6.2-config.patch to remove our downstream change to curses
configuration in Modules/Setup.dist, so that the curses modules are built using
setup.py with the downstream default (linking against libncursesw.so, rather
than libncurses.so), rather than within the Makefile; add a test to %%install
to verify the dso files that the curses module is linked against the correct
DSO (bug 539917; changes _cursesmodule.so -> _curses.so)

* Fri Jan 22 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 2.6.4-8

issue 2422; patch 52)

* Thu Nov 12 2009 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 2.6.4-3
