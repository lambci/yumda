# Notes from bootstraping Python 3.7
# ==================================
#
# New Python major version (3.X) break ABI and bytecode compatibility,
# so all packages depending on it need to be rebuilt.
#
# Due to a dependency cycle between Python, gdb, rpm, pip, setuptools, wheel,
# and other packages, this isn't straightforward.
# Build in the following order:
#
# 1. At the same time:
#     - gdb without python support (add %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#       gdb's SPEC file)
#     - python-rpm-generators
#       (this can be done also during step 2., but should be done before 3.)
# 2. python3 without rewheel (use %%bcond_with rewheel instead of
#     %%bcond_without)
# 3. gdb with python support (remove %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#    gdb's SPEC file)
# 4. rpm
# 5. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 1
# 6. python-pip with build_wheel set to 0
# 7. python-wheel with %%bcond_without bootstrap
# 8. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 0 and also with_check set to 0
# 9. python-pip with build_wheel set to 1
# 10. pyparsing
# 11. python3 with rewheel
#
# Then the most important packages have to be built, in dependency order.
# These were:
#   python-sphinx, pytest, python-requests, cloud-init, dnf, anaconda, abrt
#
# After these have been built, a targeted rebuild should be done for the rest.

%description
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{name} package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{name}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{name}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{name}-tkinter and %{name}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{name}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{name}-" prefix.

# We put the debug-gdb.py file inside /usr/lib/debug to avoid noise from ldconfig
# See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562980
#
# The /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros defines %%__debug_package to use
# debugfiles.list, and it appears that everything below /usr/lib/debug and
# (/usr/src/debug) gets added to this file (via LISTFILES) in
# /usr/lib/rpm/find-debuginfo.sh
#
# Hence by installing it below /usr/lib/debug we ensure it is added to the
# -debuginfo subpackage
# (if it doesn't, then the rpmbuild ought to fail since the debug-gdb.py
# payload file would be unpackaged)

# Workaround for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1476593

better job of things, and the %%files explicitly lists our modules (r82746
appears to break the old way of doing things).  This leads to various modules
changing from "foomodule.so" to "foo.so".  It also leads to the optimized build

_hashlib; _weakref becomes a builtin module; xxsubtype goes away (it's only for
testing/devel purposes)

than libncurses.so), rather than within the Makefile; add a test to %%install
to verify the dso files that the curses module is linked against the correct

- update patch0's setup of the crypt module to link it against libcrypt
- update patch0 to comment "datetimemodule" back out, so that it is built
