# Currently tzdata is providing the "rearguard" data set for maximum
# compatibility with existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux installs. Future releases of
# Red Hat Enterprise Linux will be transitioning to the default or "vanguard" tzdata
# data set.
#
# The "rearguard" and "vanguard" data sets are defined by the upstream tzdata project
# and represent approximately the same data, with "vanguard" optimized for newer time
# zone data tooling, and "rearguard" optimized for compatibility with existing tooling.
# For example "vanguard" implements support for negative DST offsets, while "rearguard"
# supports the traditional format.

# Create the reargard data files.
make VERSION=%{version} tzdata%{version}-rearguard.tar.gz
tar zxf tzdata%{version}-rearguard.tar.gz

# Run make to re-create the tzdata.zi file for rearguard format

    Ulyanovsk Oblasts, Russia, both of which will switch from +03 to +04 on
    2016-03-27 at 02:00 local time.  They need distinct zones since their
    post-1970 histories disagree.  New zone Asia/Barnaul for Altai Krai and
    Altai Republic, Russia, which will switch from +06 to +07 on the same date
    and local time.  The Astrakhan change is already official; the others have
    passed the first reading in the State Duma and are extremely likely.
    Also, Asia/Sakhalin moves from +10 to +11 on 2016-03-27 at 02:00.

  - Asia/Tehran now has DST predictions for the year 2038 and later,
    to be March 21 00:00 to September 21 00:00.  This is likely better

    not 06-13 and 07-18 as we had guessed.  (Thanks to Milamber.)
  - Assume Cayman Islands will observe DST starting next year, using US rules.
    Although it isn't guaranteed, it is the most likely.

* Tue Jun  9 2015 Patsy Franklin <pfrankli@redhat.com> - 2015d-3
-  Morocco will suspend DST from 2015-06-14 03:00 through 2015-07-19 02:00,

    not 00:00 on April's last Friday.  2015's transition will therefore be on
    Thursday, April 30 at 24:00, not Friday, April 24 at 00:00.  Similar fixes
    apply to 2026, 2037, 2043, etc.
