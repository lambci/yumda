%description
ecCodes is a package developed by ECMWF which provides an application
programming interface and a set of tools for decoding and encoding messages
in the following formats:

 *  WMO FM-92 GRIB edition 1 and edition 2
 *  WMO FM-94 BUFR edition 3 and edition 4 
 *  WMO GTS abbreviated header (only decoding).

A useful set of command line tools provide quick access to the messages. C,
and Fortran 90 interfaces provide access to the main ecCodes functionality.

ecCodes is an evolution of GRIB-API.  It is designed to provide the user with
a simple set of functions to access data from several formats with a key/value
approach.

For GRIB encoding and decoding, the GRIB-API functionality is provided fully
in ecCodes with only minor interface and behaviour changes. Interfaces for C,
and Fortran 90 are all maintained as in GRIB-API.  However, the
GRIB-API Fortran 77 interface is no longer available.

In addition, a new set of functions with the prefix "codes_" is provided to
operate on all the supported message formats. These functions have the same
interface and behaviour as the "grib_" functions. 

A selection of GRIB-API tools has been included in ecCodes (ecCodes GRIB
tools), while new tools are available for the BUFR (ecCodes BUFR tools) and
GTS formats. The new tools have been developed to be as similar as possible
to the existing GRIB-API tools maintaining, where possible, the same options
and behaviour. A significant difference compared with GRIB-API tools is that
bufr_dump produces output in JSON format suitable for many web based
applications.

This package provides all tables and definitions needed
to encode and decode grib and bufr files, and includes
both the official WMO tables and a number of often used

#-- The following features are disabled by default and not switched on:
#
# * AEC , support for Adaptive Entropy Coding
# * MEMFS , Memory based access to definitions/samples
# * MEMORY_MANAGEMENT , enable memory management
# * ALIGN_MEMORY , enable memory alignment
# * GRIB_TIMER , enable timer
# * ECCODES_THREADS , enable POSIX threads
#
#-- The following features are disabled by default and switched on:
# * PNG , support for PNG decoding/encoding
# * ECCODES_OMP_THREADS , enable OMP threads
# * EXTRA_TESTS , enable extended regression testing
#
#-- The following features are set to AUTO by default and
#   explicitely switched on to ensure they don't vanish unnoticed
#   in case of dependency problems during the build:
# * ENABLE_JPG
# ^ ENABLE_FORTRAN
# * ENABLE_NETCDF
#   NetCDF is only needed to create the grib_to_netcdf convert tool
#
# * ENABLE_PYTHON has value AUTO as default, so if python2 is available
#   during a package build it will build an interface for it.
#   To make sure it does not do so,  explicitely switch it off.
#   Python3 support has been moved to an additional project now,
#   so python handling has been removed completely from this spec file.
#
#-- Also add an explicit option to not use rpath
#
# Note: -DINSTALL_LIB_DIR=%%{_lib} is needed because otherwise
#        the library so files get installed in /usr/lib in stead
#        of /usr/lib64 on x86_64.
